This is iptel.org implementation of STUN (RFC3489) server.  

WARNING: This project has never been polished, QA-ed,
stress-tested, documented, and otherwise finalized. 
Absolutely no guarantee for proper functionality, user 
friendliness, portability, merchantability, fitness 
for a particular purpose, performance, etc.

Nevertheless, our experimental operation on a linux machine 
with an interface with two IP addresses has been just fine.


Developer notes 
---------------
(Andrei): it uses pthread+sysv shared memory
for some locks which is tricky. pthread semaphores are not
guaranteed to work between processes on linux, and in this
case the only work because they are initialized in shared
memory.

    (Ondra) pthread semafores are no longer used
  
(Jiri): in PID file, ID of process is recorded which
disappears during daemonization;

(Gabriel gabriel.vasile@gmail.com): the server requires a 
machine with two network addresses, as it has to send 
responses from two different ip addresses
